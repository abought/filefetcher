# File Fetcher

## Purpose

Many bioinformatics pipeline tasks rely on large data files, often pre-processed in such a way as to support fast 
lookups. To make libraries re-usable, it should be easy to create the files programmatically, and to download 
pre-made versions from a remote server. (rather than spending hours generating data structures on first install).

Additionally, it should be possible to get the newest versions based on some automated server process.  

This library abstracts the tasks of locating, downloading, or creating the necessary pieces, as appropriate.
